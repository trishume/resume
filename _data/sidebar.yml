- title: About
  content: |
    I'm a UWaterloo CS student who's been working as a developer for 5 years and programming for 10. My many open source projects have over 20,000 combined users (300,000 if you count web apps). I'm particularly interested in computer vision, compilers, hardware and finance.
- title: Reading
  content: |
    For the past 8 years I've spent around 2 hours per day on average reading about programming and tech.
    I've read hundreds of academic papers (mostly on compilers, HCI, computer vision, and databases), tons of articles (largely from 5 years of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)), and many books.

# - title: More Projects
#   content: |
#     I've done a <em>lot</em> of side projects over the years, and there isn't enough room for all of them here.
#     I keep a list on <a href="http://thume.ca/">my website</a> and you can also look at

- title: Anecdotal Evidence

    I can contribute at the level of an experienced full time employee: At Shopify I was one of two interns (out of hundreds in the past) to get a significant unsolicited raise to the pay level of a full time employee, as well as stock options.
