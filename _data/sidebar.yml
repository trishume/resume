    title: About
    content: |
      I’m an enthusiastic developer who has spent the last 10 years building dozens of projects using a large variety of languages and technologies. I’m also building a solid academic groundwork through my studies as a CS student, research work, and spending lots of my spare time reading. I'm a 3rd year student with a GPA of 88% and 94% in-major.

    title: Open Source
    content: |
      I've created dozens of open source projects with over 20,000 combined users (300,000 if you count web apps), all of which you can find [on my Github page](//github.com/trishume).

      I was also the [first contributor](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#first-times) and [long time](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commits?author=trishume&page=1) top contributor to [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), a now quite popular configuration package for Emacs.

      I once went on a 201 day long Github streak.

      My strongest languages are Ruby, Rust and C++.
      I've written over 10,000 lines of code in each of these languages.

      I also enjoy learning new languages: I've done projects in 22
      different languages including Javascript, Haskell, D, Go, and OCaml.
