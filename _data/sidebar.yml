    title: About
    content: |
      I'm a UWaterloo CS student who's been working as a developer for 5 years and programming for 10. My many open source projects have over 20,000 combined users (300,000 if you count web apps). I'm particularly interested in computer vision, compilers, and finance.

    title: Reading
    content: |
      For the past 8 years I've spent around 2 hours per day on average reading about programming and tech.
      I've read hundreds of academic papers (mostly on compilers, HCI, computer vision, and databases), tons of articles (largely from 5 years of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)), and many books on programming.
