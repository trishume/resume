    title: About
    content: |
      I'm a programming enthusiast who's spent years working on a broad variety of projects both for fun and for many different companies. I've also spent hours nearly every day since grade 4 reading about programming online. I have especially deep knowledge and experience in compilers, graphics, computer vision and high-performance systems.

      I also give [talks](http://thume.ca/talks/), have fun at security CTF contests (including the [DEF CON finals](http://thume.ca/2018/08/16/def-con-26-ctf-writeups/)) and enjoy dodgeball.

    title: Open Source
    content: |
      I've created dozens of open source projects used by hundreds of thousands of people and libraries incorporated into products by multiple companies, all of which you can find [on my Github page](//github.com/trishume).

      I was also the [first contributor](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#first-times) and [long time](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commits?author=trishume&page=1) top contributor to [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), a now quite popular configuration package for Emacs.

      I once went on a 201 day long Github streak.
