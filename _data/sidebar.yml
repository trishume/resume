    title: About
    content: |
      I'm a UWaterloo CS student who's been working as a developer for 5 years and programming for 10. I'm particularly interested in computer vision, compilers, and finance. My many open source projects have over 20,000 combined users (300,000 if you count web apps).

    title: Reading
    content: |
      For the past 8 years I've spent on average 2 hours per day reading about programming and technology. That adds up to 3 times the number of lecture hours in a CS degree.
      I've read hundreds of academic papers (mostly on HCI, compilers, computer vision, and databases), thousands of articles (largely from 5 years of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)), and dozens of programming books.

      At Shopify I was one of two interns (out of hundreds in the past) to get a significant unsolicited raise to the pay level of a full time employee, as well as stock options, in the middle of my co-op term.
